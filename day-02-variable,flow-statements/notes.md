## Day 2 â€“ Variables, Constants, Types, Loops & Conditions

###  Topics Covered:
- Variable declaration using `var` and `:=`
- Constants using `const`
- Data types: string, int, bool
- Type conversion using `strconv`
- Flow control: if/else
- Looping: for loop

---

###  Key Concepts:

- `var` lets you define variables with type
- `:=` lets Go infer type (only inside functions)
- `const` defines unchangeable values
- Go is strongly typed: manual conversion is required
- `for` is the only loop in Go
- `if/else` is used for conditions

---

### Project Summary:

Built a CLI app that:
- Collects name and score for 3 students
- Uses a loop to repeat the input
- Converts string to int
- Uses if-else to assign grade
- Displays a formatted student summary
